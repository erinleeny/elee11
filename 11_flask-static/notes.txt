# K11 -- Some Things Never Change
# Looked at the flask-static project, made predictions, and recorded the actual outcomes and our responses to the questions.

> Predictions: We predicted that the two links would render the txt file and html file for static/foo and static/foo.html in the browser, respectively.
> Actual Outcome: Upon actually testing it out, the static/foo does not render any sort of webpage, and instead downloads the file to your computer
> Q: What happens when you access this file via http://localhost:5000/static/foo ?
> Going to static/foo downloads the foo.txt file, and continues to stay on the root page
> the root page shows “No hablo queso” as usual
>Q: What happens when you access this file via http://localhost:5000/static/foo.html?
> Going to static/foo.html renders the HTML page in the static directory, which has “this here some plaintext tho”
