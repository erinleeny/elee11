MongoDB Notes

Inserting New Documents
> _id is already populated
	> ObjectId(), the default but can be filled in
> some data types: string, int, address (object), date
> duplicate key error for inserting the same document with the same id
> drop can be appended to remove the entry before inserting another
> .findOne() 
	> returns one of the query
> you can have identical query as long as the _id is different

Inserting Multiple Documents
> .insert([{}, {}, {}]) JSONs in an array
> default behavior: ordered = true
	> documents inserted in the order they are in
	> documents after the insertion errors will not be added/inserted if set to true instead of false
> MongoDB lets you easily create new collections, db.<new db>.insert()
