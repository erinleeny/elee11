# Team Tiny Elephant (Jeffrey Huang, Erin Lee, Jonathan Lee)
# SoftDev
# K08 -- Cross Pollination and Virtual Insanity (Task Alpha)
# As a team, we visited the workshops of other students (including those of our team) and 
# observed their assignment K07. We took note of how other teams approached the 
# assignment, whether they used the csv or random library, whether they had a large quantity 
# of code that could have been simplified, etc.

OBSERVATIONS
Many groups used csv libraries (like the reader)
A lot of people used DictReader to decipher/filter their dictionaries
Some print statements ended up with a lot of jam packed code/information that was not easily decipherable. Others had more clean and readable code by splitting their information/lines into variables!!
Function for printing out the job based on weighted percentages is either: using random.choices function or brute forces its way
The random choice and randrange were used in the same contexts to accomplish the same things, though the choice method was far more streamlined.
To get rid of the first and last statements, teams popped keys/values in the dictionary at the end to remove the header and total, OR they used if statements, OR they used for loops for a certain range.
