python3 -m venv ~/myherozero   

This command creates a virtual environment (virtualenv or in the command, “venv”), which is a self-contained, 
separate instance of Python runtime environment that has its own packages or setup. The “myzerohero” is the created 
directory that stores the supported files for the virtual environment, the library, and the Python interpreter/instructions. 
Upon activating the virtual environment in the terminal (source myherozero/bin/activate), the terminal will change the prompt 
to one of the virtual environments, using its specific Python installation/version.

The need to create a virtual environment is to allow the user to avoid installing Python packages globally (some projects requiring 
one version of Python and another requiring a different version, having only one version prevents both from working). By creating a 
venv, the user can switch between environments when working on projects that require different packages.
