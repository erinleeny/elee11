#Line 10 will print "the __name__ of this module is…” in the terminal 
#Line 11 will print “__main__” in the terminal
#Line 12 prints "No hablo queso!" in the webpage
#If true, decided by whether the file is imported or not, line 15 will enable the debugging mode (makes available: variable names, line numbers, etc. from the source code)
#Upon running, the terminal prints that Debug mode is on and that the Debugger is active (also provided a debugger pin), and detects changes to the source code and restarts with stat
