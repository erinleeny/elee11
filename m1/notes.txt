MongoDB Notes

Introduction
> MongoDB is a NoSQL database: doesnâ€™t use related tables (no rows or columns) and stores in collections
> collection: organized store, usually with common fields between documents

Cloud
> Atlas cloud database: Mongo used at its core
> deploy clusters: group of servers that stores your data
> replica set: a few connected machines that store the same data to ensure data remains intact (backup)

> JSON: the document format (key: value, key: value})
	> readable, friendly, familiar
	> text-based, space-consuming, limited
> BSON: binary JSON, optimized
> Anything in JSON can be viewed in Mongo! Mongo stores data as BSON, but users view it in JSON
